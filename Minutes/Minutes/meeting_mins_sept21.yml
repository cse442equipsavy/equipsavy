Notes:  | # Anything covered in the meeting that doesn't fit elsewhere.

  - We want to have the following done by sprint 2: 

- Either add CSS and make it look pretty or use a Backend and Front-end developing.

- Probably can use django or python for back end for web development

       - can use a pre-made backend system if we don’t want to worry about security

       - Some members (3) need to start working on the backend so that we can start linking the pages together

       - While some members (3) will need to continue to work on the front end 

- Make the project independent so that you do not have to use the UB Authentication

- Will start working on the backend in Django, if that doesn’t work then we will work on backend using Python

- Using Google authentication maybe easier

- One person can work on the template for all the pages and the others can work on the functionality of the webpage

- Everyone needs to go to the github issues page and talk about what each member will be working on this sprint

- If there is a page that you like you can use it as a template but will need to cite it

- Email confirmation that the student has reserved an equipment and when the TA approves the reservation then

an email will be sent to the student confirming
