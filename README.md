442 project

equipsavy is a project to enable checkout of equipment. We are personalizing the project towards a classroom environment where there will be instructor access to add/remove equipment and verify checkouts. Students will be able to go on the web page, log in, choose what items they want to checkout (if available) and check them out (instructor verification may be required to approve a checkout item request).
